# simple-sudoku-solver
  A simple sudoku solver written in python. I call it simple because it's only use python's basic syntaxes, no additional library. My method to solve this problem is simplify the system first. To figure how it's works, i made prototypes : 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 sudoku. And then i use the same algorithm to make 9x9 sudoku solver.
